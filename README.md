Bot made with Python for AdventureQuest Worlds that runs in the terminal window


## Notes
This bot in this stage may or may not work in your computer. I will keep updating it and publish a release version when I'm sure it works on other computers, but feel free to mess around with it.

## Features

- Farm gold on Battlegrounde



## Installation
Go to the root folder and type in the terminal

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If that doesn't work, try
```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run
```bash
src/main.py
```
## Configurations and Hardware

Since this bot is still in early stages of development all of the below mentioned
requirements are a must

In-Game
